# Phi-Net: 3D Convolutional Neural Network Implemented with Keras
## Background
Classifying modalities in magnetic resonance brain imaging with deep learning.

## Tutorial with some dataset
### Image Preprocessing
1. downsample
2. robust FOV
3. zero-pad
### Training
1. Download some dataset
2. install dependencies
3. etc
4. train
### Classify
1. run the prediction file
2. etc
3. done
### Results from downsampled data
accuracy, training time, testing time
### Results from 3D patches
accuracy, training time, testing time
### Configuration
